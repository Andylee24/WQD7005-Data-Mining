The case study focuses on analyzing customer behavior in an e-commerce context using a dataset of customer transactions. The primary objective is to understand the factors that influence customer churn, which is defined as customers ceasing to purchase from the e-commerce platform. 

Key goals of the case study include:

1. **Data Understanding and Preparation:**
   - To explore customer attributes and purchase history.
   - To preprocess the data by handling missing values and ensuring data quality.

2. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - To employ a decision tree to identify key predictors of churn.
   - To use ensemble methods, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to improve the predictive accuracy.

3. **Behavioral Insights:**
   - To gain insights into customer purchase patterns and preferences.
   - To determine the profile of customers who are at risk of churning.

4. **Business Strategy Development:**
   - To leverage the model findings to devise strategies aimed at improving customer retention.
   - To suggest targeted interventions for customer segments identified as having a higher churn risk.
